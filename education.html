		<h2>What is this issue?</h2>
			<p>Millions of people around the world do not get to go to school and get an education. Many people who are living in areas in Asia or Africa do not have enough money to build schools for their students. Reasons why people cannot go to school are poverty, financial issues, and marginalisation. 
</p>
		<h2>Why is education important?</h2>
			<p>Education is important because it makes the world more advance. More people have knowledge about the science, english, or math and can improve the world. People can find more cures for diseases, improve technology, discover hidden facts about the Earth and the universe, and help the environment.
